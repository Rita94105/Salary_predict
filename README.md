# [Data Engineer Salary Predict](https://rita94105.shinyapps.io/Salary_2024/)

In our Data Science course this semester, we were particularly intrigued by the current landscape of data science-related careers, specifically focusing on compensation trends. To satisfy our curiosity and academic requirements, we decided to explore a relevant dataset found on Kaggle: "Data Engineer Salary in 2024."

## Data Preprocessing

### Library

1.  [smotfamily](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smotefamily/smotefamily.pdf)
2.  [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf)
3.  [dataPreparation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataPreparation/index.html)
4.  [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)

### Process

1.  Checking the type of data
2.  Dropping the duplicate data
3.  Counting the number of rows
4.  Dropping the missing or null value
5.  Detecting outliers
6.  SMOTE
7.  Ordinal Encoding
8.  Target Encoding
9.  function signedlog10(): transform our prediction target.
``` r
# sin log function
signedlog10 <- function(x) {
  ifelse(abs(x) <= 1, 0, sign(x) * log10(abs(x)))
}
```

## Model Training and Results

### Target Encoding

We use target encoding to calculate the mean of **signedlog10(salary_in_usd)** for each feature.

After target encoding, we use [ggcorrplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggcorrplot/ggcorrplot.pdf) to generate the correlation matrix for the features.

![](/output/correlation_matrix.png)

``` r
library(ggcorrplot)
correlation_matrix <- cor(data %>% select(-salary_in_usd))
ggcorrplot(correlation_matrix, lab = T)+
  labs(title = "correlation matrix",
       x = "",
       y = "")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text("BL", "bold", "black", size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text("BL", "bold", "black", size = 10, hjust = 1),
        title = element_text("BL", "bold", size = 10))
```

### Training

1. We use [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) and gradient boosting ([gbm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/gbm.html)) to build an ensemble learning model to predict **signedlog10(salary_in_usd)**.

2. Ensemble Learning: Use [caret](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html) and [caretEnsemble](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caretEnsemble/index.html)
- Functions for creating ensembles of caret models: caretList() and caretStack(). caretList() is a convenience function for fitting multiple caret::train() models to the same dataset. caretStack() will make linear or non-linear combinations of these models, using a caret::train() model as a meta-model, and caretEnsemble() will make a robust linear combination of models using a GLM.

4. We also use cross-validation (5-fold) and grid search to find the best hyperparameters.
5. We use **RMSE of salary_in_usd** to evaluate the performance of model.

- null model: use linear regression(only intercept)
```r
null_model <- lm(salary_in_usd~1, data = train_data)
summary(null_model)

null_rmse <- RMSE(train_data$salary_in_usd %>% arcsignedlog10,
                  null_model$fitted.values %>% arcsignedlog10)
```

- ensemble model = random forest + gradient boosting
``` r
library(randomForest)
library(gbm)

library(caret)
library(caretEnsemble)

# cross validation
ctrl <- trainControl(
  method = "cv",                
  number = 5,                   
  savePredictions = "final",    
  returnData = TRUE,            
  returnResamp = "final",       
  verboseIter = TRUE            
)

# grid search
rf_grid <- expand.grid(
  mtry = c(2)
)

gbm_grid <- expand.grid(
  n.trees = 150,
  interaction.depth = 3,
  shrinkage = 0.1,
  n.minobsinnode = 10
)

# model_list
model_list <- caretList(
  salary_in_usd~.,
  data = train_data, 
  metric = "RMSE",
  verbose = T,
  trControl = ctrl,
  tuneList = list(
    rf = caretModelSpec("rf", tuneGrid = rf_grid),
    gbm = caretModelSpec("gbm", tuneGrid = gbm_grid)
  )
)

# ensemble model
ens_model <- caretEnsemble(model_list)
```

## Conclusion
Our accuracy is already significantly better than other results on Kaggle. 

However, this is a passable result. We need more data or features to optimize our model training to achieve results that most people can accept. 

Nonetheless, during the training process, we found that job_title is the most important feature, indicating that job titles play a crucial role in predicting salaries.
